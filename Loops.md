# Loops are when something repeats over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.


# a for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# the while loop can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
# The break is used to break out a for loop, or a while loop.
# The continue is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
