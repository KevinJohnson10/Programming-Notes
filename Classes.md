# Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes.

# To create a class, use the keyword class, then you can create objects using the name of the class.

# To create methods, you add @classmethod decorator before the method definition, and add cls as the first parameter to the method.

# To create properties, you call property() with an appropriate set of arguments and assigning its return value to a class attribute.
