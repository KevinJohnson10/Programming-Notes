# Functions are a block of statements that return the specific task. They are useful because they bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly.
# Loops are when something repeats over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.
# Datatypes are the classification or categorization of data items.\
# Strings are a data structure that represents a sequence of characters.
# Subroutines are a name for a block of code.
# Modules are files containing definitions and statements.
# Tuples are a collection of objects separated by commas.
# Else is used in conditional statements (if statements), and decides what to do if the condition is False.
# Elif is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition.
# Lists are dynamically sized arrays.
# Variables are containers for storing data values.
# Yield is used to create a generator function.
# Def is used to define a function.
# Try lets you test a block of code for errors.
# Continue is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
# Del is used to delete objects.
# Assert checks if the statement is True or False.
# With replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand.
# Async makes requests and does not block to wait for them to complete.
# And is a logical operator.
# As is used to create an alias.
# While runs a piece of code while a condition is True.
# Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
# If decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not.
# Break allows you to exit a loop when an external condition is met.
# Import makes code in one module available in another.
# Global modifies the global variable outside its current scope and meaning.
# Not inverts the truth value of Boolean expressions and objects.
# From imports only a specified section from a module.
# Raise raises a specific exception when a condition is met or the code encounters an error.
