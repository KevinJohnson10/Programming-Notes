# Glossary



**Functions:** A block of statements that return the specific task. They are useful because they bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly.
**Loops:** When something repeats over and over until a particular condition is satisfied.
**Datatypes:** The classification or categorization of data items.
**Strings:** A data structure that represents a sequence of characters.
**Subroutines:** A name for a block of code.
**Modules:** Files containing definitions and statements.
**Tuples:** A collection of objects separated by commas.
**Else:** Is used in conditional statements (if statements), and decides what to do if the condition is False.
**Elif:** Is used when the first if statement isn't true, but you want to check for another condition.
**Lists:** Dynamically sized arrays.
**Variables:** Containers for storing data values.
**Yield:** Is used to create a generator function.
**Def:** Is used to define a function.
**Try:** Lets you test a block of code for errors.
**Continue:** Is used to end the current iteration in a for loop (or a while loop), and continues to the next iteration.
**Del:** Is used to delete objects.
**Assert:** Checks if the statement is True or False.
**With:** Replaces a try-catch block with a concise shorthand.
**Async:** Makes requests and does not block to wait for them to complete.
**And:** Is a logical operator.
**As:** Is used to create an alias.
**While:** Runs a piece of code while a condition is True.
**Classes:** Provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
**If:** Decides whether certain statements need to be executed or not.
**Break:** Allows you to exit a loop when an external condition is met.
**Import:** Makes code in one module available in another.
**Global:** Modifies the global variable outside its current scope and meaning.
**Not:** Inverts the truth value of Boolean expressions and objects.
**From:** Imports only a specified section from a module.
**Raise:** Raises a specific exception when a condition is met or the code encounters an error.
**Int:** Is a built-in method that converts a string or a number into an integer.
**Float:** Is a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers.
**Boolean:** Is a built in data type which represents one of the two values i.e. True or False.
**Data Types:** The classification or categorization of knowledge items.
**Type Conversations:** The process of converting a Python data type into another data type.
**String Literal:** Is where you specify the contents of a string in a program.
**Arithmetic Operators:** A mathematical function that performs a calculation on two operands.
**Comparison Operators:** Compare the values on either side of them and returns a boolean value.
**Logical Operators:** and, or, and not.
**Or:** Returns the first object that evaluates to true or the last object in the expression, regardless of its truth value.
**While Loops:** Used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied.
**For Loops:** Used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
**PIP:** Installs and manages software packages.
